# WorkTestVanilla

WorkTest in recruitment process.<br>

All vanilla javascript. Back to basics! <br>
Work test for employer requesting:<br>
The test involves creating a simpler landing page/one-page site with two modules, as well as a simple header and footer. <br>
We want you to code without external libraries, both CSS and JS from scratch and vanilla, that is. <br>
We will assess the semantics, accessibility, and "div-itus" of the HTML code, how structured the CSS is, and the quality of the JS code. <br>
Users should be able to change the color theme of the page using a button in the header. The background color and text color will change throughout the site (including the image overlay in the hero section, transitioning from light to dark).<br>
It is not necessary to strictly follow the sketch for fonts, margins, etc. The important parts are the appearance of the gallery and the color theme functionality. <br>
The images in the gallery should always maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio, regardless of the image uploaded through a potential admin panel and then used in the HTML code (so don't rely on the images always being in a 1:1 ratio). <br>
The page needs to be responsive and perform well on different platforms.
