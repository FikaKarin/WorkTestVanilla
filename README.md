# WorkTestVanilla

WorkTest in recruitment process.

All vanilla javascript. Back to basics!
Work test for employer requesting:
The test involves creating a simpler landing page/one-page site with two modules, as well as a simple header and footer. 
We want you to code without external libraries, both CSS and JS from scratch and vanilla, that is. 
We will assess the semantics, accessibility, and "div-itus" of the HTML code, how structured the CSS is, and the quality of the JS code. 
Users should be able to change the color theme of the page using a button in the header. The background color and text color will change throughout the site (including the image overlay in the hero section, transitioning from light to dark).
It is not necessary to strictly follow the sketch for fonts, margins, etc. The important parts are the appearance of the gallery and the color theme functionality. 
The images in the gallery should always maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio, regardless of the image uploaded through a potential admin panel and then used in the HTML code (so don't rely on the images always being in a 1:1 ratio). 
The page needs to be responsive and perform well on different platforms.
